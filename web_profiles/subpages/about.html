        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>Lee Tutoring was founded by Edward Lee in 2018 to bring high-quality, data-driven test prep from professional tutors to Tampa Bay. From the beginning, our mission has been to help students achieve scores that represent what they are truly capable of–and then some. Who we are is defined by what we do, and what we do is get results. We help students qualify for Bright Futures and improve their confidence in school and themselves for college and beyond.</p>
