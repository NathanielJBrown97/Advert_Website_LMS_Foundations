            <p class="title">Founder & Lead Tutor</p>
            <p>Edward, a St. Petersburg native, has over a decade of experience as a professional tutor. His career in test prep began with a company in Atlanta, where he was quickly recognized and promoted for the results he helped his students achieve. When he saw a growing need for personalized local tutoring in Pinellas and the surrounding counties, Edward took his talents back to Florida. He started Lee Tutoring in 2018 to provide his hometown with his honed academic and test prep tutoring skills, backed up by his demonstrated record of student success. Since then, he has helped hundreds of students achieve standardized test and academic success locally, nationally, and even across the globe.
                <br><br><br>
                Edward has experience tutoring and empowering students with learning differences such as ADHD and dyslexia. To make sure those students’ needs are met, he’s helped families secure accommodations for test day. He is especially proud of his global partnership with computer science students in Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia.
                <br><br><br>
                When he’s not helping students achieve their goals and master study skills, he enjoys spending time with his fiancée and their 14-year-old Australian Shepherd Mama Dog, the unofficial mascot of Lee Tutoring.

            <p class="title">Reading Comprehension Specialist</p>
            <p>In 2022, Lee Tutoring welcomed aboard our first employee: Reading Comprehension Specialist Eli Epstein. Eli began his career tutoring his peers in college and has become an integral part of our team. He quickly adapted his teaching style to Edward’s proven methods. His mastery of reading comprehension and English makes him an invaluable asset to students looking to improve their scores on the SAT and ACT. Notably, Eli was a part of the team when we helped a student achieve a record 14 point ACT score increase in 2022!
                <br><br><br>
                In his free time, Eli loves to cook and entertain. He spends as much time as he can outside, and likes to know “just enough to be dangerous” about everything he can. Though he has no pets in the traditional sense, he enjoys the company of his many houseplants.
